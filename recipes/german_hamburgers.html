    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Frikadellen, the original hamburger, are served like a flattened meatball with string beans and salad. I also like to use this recipe to make Swedish meatballs (but omit the paprika).</p>
    <p>My aunt in Hamburg, Germany, taught me this recipe, and I've been making it ever since. Serve with steamed string beans and tossed salad. Or serve on a kaiser roll with lettuce, tomato, pickled cucumbers, finely sliced deep-fried onions, and curry ketchup.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 kaiser roll</li>
        <li>⅔ pound ground beef</li>
        <li>⅓ pound ground pork</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Hungarian hot paprika (Optional)</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak kaiser roll in a medium bowl of water for 10 minutes. Drain and squeeze out excess water; crumble into a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Add ground meats, onion, parsley, egg, paprika, salt, and black pepper to crumbled roll; mix until well blended. Shape mixture into large flattened meatballs.</li>
        <li>Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Fry meatballs in the hot skillet until browned and no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a patty should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
